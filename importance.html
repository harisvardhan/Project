 <h1>Why We Need to Protect Our Water</h1>
 <p>Water is essential for all forms of life, and yet it is often taken for granted. Here are some reasons why we need to protect our water:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Water is a finite resource. Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is fresh, and only a fraction of that is accessible to us.</li>
 <li>Water is essential for agriculture. 70% of the world's freshwater is used for agriculture, and this percentage is expected to increase as the global population grows.</li>
 <li>Water is essential for industry. Many industries, such as manufacturing and energy production, rely heavily on water.</li>
 <li>Water is essential for human health. Access to clean water is essential for preventing waterborne diseases and maintaining good hygiene.</li>
 </ul>
