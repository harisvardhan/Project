Comprehensive lnspection and Analysis of Water Supply Distribution Lines

Water resources across the globe are slowly on the depletion and its forecasted that the ZERO water day will not be far away if water resources ate not protected well. one the the crucial area that stilp lies in the human hands is to save the watet leakages and pay a strong water distrulibution network that improves effeicient use of water.The challenge is to conduct thorough inspections of water supply distribution lines, ranging from 100 to 200mm in diameter, in order to detect leakages, pilferage, damage, and other issues. The solution requires access to a cloud_based dashboard for data analytics, visualization, and report generation. The solution enhance service delivery, improve repair work efficiency, reduce water leakage, and streamline pipeline condition assessment. The solution should enable immediate action on contamination complaints, early detection of leaks, reduction in labor_intensive breakdown management, and facilitate GIS mapping of the pipelines. Overcoming deployment constraints involving live inspections, image analytics, and laser projections will ensure accurate and efficient assessment of the water supply distribution lines.
